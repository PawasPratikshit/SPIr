Description: 
    The SPIr package provides tools for computing and analyzing the Segment 
    Pivotality Index (SPI), a diagnostic measure designed for hierarchical 
    electoral systems in which intermediate units (e.g., Assembly Constituencies) 
    aggregate into larger electoral units (e.g., Parliamentary Constituencies). 
    SPI quantifies how pivotal a sub-constituency is to determining the final 
    outcome of its parent constituency, making it especially useful in settings 
    where fine-grained, precinct-level results are unavailable. The package 
    includes functions for calculating SPI, merging SPI estimates back into 
    candidate-level data, summarizing SPI distributions, and generating 
    visualizations for exploratory analysis. Although motivated by the Indian 
    electoral context, SPIr is generalizable to any multi-tier electoral system 
    or hierarchical dataset.
