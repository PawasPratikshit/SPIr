\title{SPIr: Segment Pivotality Index for Hierarchical Electoral Data}
\description{
The SPIr package provides tools to compute and analyse the Segment
Pivotality Index (SPI) for elections with hierarchical structures,
such as Assembly Constituencies (ACs) nested within Parliamentary
Constituencies (PCs). SPI quantifies how pivotal each sub-constituency
is to the final outcome of the parent constituency, especially when
only meso-level data are available and precinct-level returns are
missing.

The SPIr package provides tools for computing and analyzing the Segment Pivotality Index (SPI), a diagnostic measure designed for hierarchical electoral systems in which intermediate units (e.g., Assembly Constituencies) aggregate into larger electoral units (e.g., Parliamentary Constituencies). SPI quantifies how pivotal a sub-constituency is to determining the final outcome of its parent constituency, making it especially useful in settings where fine-grained, precinct-level results are unavailable. The package includes functions for calculating SPI, merging SPI estimates back into candidate-level data, summarizing SPI distributions, and generating visualizations for exploratory analysis. Although motivated by the Indian electoral context, SPIr is generalizable to any multi-tier electoral system or hierarchical dataset.

\details{
The package includes functions to compute SPI at the segment level,
merge SPI back into candidate-level data, summarise SPI distributions,
and visualise them for exploratory analysis. Although motivated by the
Indian electoral context, the methods are general and can be applied
to any hierarchical dataset (e.g., branches within firms, districts
within regions).

Main functions:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{compute_spi}} – compute SPI at the segment level.
\item \code{\link{add_spi}} – attach SPI values back to candidate-level data.
\item \code{\link{summary_spi}} – summarise SPI distributions.
\item \code{\link{plot_spi_distribution}} – visualise SPI distributions.
\item \code{\link{spi_help}} – print a short usage guide and workflow.
